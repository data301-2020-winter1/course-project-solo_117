## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{My goal will be to determine within a statistical degree of certainty who was/is the best player to ever play for the Calgary Flames. The Calgary Flames are a hockey team based in Calgary that play in the NHL. The team was established in 1980 and has won one Stanley cup. The data set I will be pulling from contains many different attributes on every player to have ever played for the Flames. To determine which player is the best I will be looking at a combination of many attributes, which should be able to yield a conclusion of who was/is the best. I chose this topic because I grew up in Calgary and thought it would be cool to apply some data science to a team I have watched my whole life.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The data I am using comes directly from the officila NHL website. The data contains the name of every player to have played on the flames and many attributes about them such as goals scored, penalty minutes, date of birth, height, weight, and birth town. The data was collected from October 1980 to july 2020. The purpose of this data was for accountability of actions taken while playing. In 1980 it was a human that recorded all the data, but now it is electronically done.}
